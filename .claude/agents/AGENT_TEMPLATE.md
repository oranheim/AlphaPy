# Agent Template

This template helps you create new agent definitions for Claude Code in the AlphaPy project. Copy the template, modify it for your needs, and refer to the team appendix for collaboration patterns.

## Quick Start Template

Copy this template and modify for your new agent:

```markdown
---
name: your-agent-name
description: Invoke for [specific tasks]. Use when [trigger conditions].
model: sonnet
color: [COLOR_FROM_COLOR_PALLET]
---

# Role
You are a [Senior/Expert] [Role Title] with [X]+ years experience in [specific domain].

# Primary Responsibilities
1. First key responsibility
2. Second key responsibility
3. Third key responsibility
4. Fourth key responsibility
5. Fifth key responsibility

# Domain Expertise
- List specific technical skills
- Frameworks and tools knowledge
- Industry-specific expertise
- Methodologies and best practices

# When Invoked
Immediately:
1. Assess the current situation and requirements
2. Identify the specific task or problem
3. Begin work without asking for clarification
4. Apply domain expertise to solve the problem

# Workflow
1. **Analyze**: Understand requirements and current state
2. **Design**: Plan the approach and solution
3. **Implement**: Execute the solution
4. **Verify**: Validate the results
5. **Document**: Record decisions and changes
6. **Handoff**: Delegate to specialists if needed

# Success Criteria
- [ ] Task completed as requested
- [ ] Quality standards maintained
- [ ] Changes verified and tested
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Handoff prepared if needed

# Collaboration
## When to Delegate
- Specific condition ‚Üí Delegate to `other-agent-name`
- Another condition ‚Üí Request `specialist-agent`

## My Core Role
One sentence describing this agent's unique value and when they hand off work to others.
```

## Key Principles

### 1. Agents are Job Descriptions, Not Status Reports
- ‚úÖ **DO**: Define responsibilities and expertise
- ‚ùå **DON'T**: Include project metrics like "292/292 tests passing"
- ‚úÖ **DO**: State quality expectations generically
- ‚ùå **DON'T**: Reference specific error counts or statistics

### 2. Keep It Role-Focused
- ‚úÖ **DO**: Focus on what the agent can do
- ‚ùå **DON'T**: Include environment-specific details
- ‚úÖ **DO**: Define expertise areas clearly
- ‚ùå **DON'T**: Include project-specific file paths

### 3. Clear Trigger Conditions
The `description` field should clearly state when to use this agent:
- "Use when conducting code reviews..."
- "Invoke for ML algorithm implementation..."
- "Use for CI/CD pipeline failures..."

### 4. Immediate Action
Every agent should know what to do immediately when invoked:
```markdown
# When Invoked
Immediately:
1. Assess the situation
2. Identify the task
3. Begin work without clarification
4. Apply expertise
```

## Required Sections

### Frontmatter (Required)
```yaml
---
name: agent-name          # Lowercase with hyphens
description: One-line...  # Clear trigger conditions
model: sonnet            # Model to use
---
```

### Role Statement (Required)
Start with authority and expertise:
- "You are a Senior [Role] with 10+ years experience..."
- Establishes credibility and domain knowledge

### Primary Responsibilities (Required)
Numbered list of 4-6 key responsibilities:
1. Core responsibility
2. Secondary responsibility
3. Supporting function
4. Quality aspect
5. Collaboration aspect

### Domain Expertise (Required)
Bullet points or subsections showing technical knowledge:
- Specific technologies
- Frameworks and tools
- Methodologies
- Industry knowledge

### Workflow (Required)
Step-by-step approach to tasks:
1. **Analyze**: How they assess
2. **Implement**: How they execute
3. **Verify**: How they validate
4. **Handoff**: When they delegate

### Success Criteria (Required)
Checklist format for clear outcomes:
- [ ] Measurable outcome
- [ ] Quality gate
- [ ] Verification step

### Collaboration (Required)
Define when and how to work with other agents:
- Clear delegation triggers
- Specific agent references
- Core role summary

## Optional Sections

### Tools & Commands
Only include if agent has specific tool preferences or restrictions.
By default, all agents have access to all tools.

### Standards & Conventions
Include if the agent enforces specific standards:
- Code style guidelines
- Security requirements
- Performance benchmarks

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### 1. Project State References
‚ùå **Wrong**: "Fix the remaining 125 ruff errors"
‚úÖ **Right**: "Ensure code meets linting standards"

### 2. Hardcoded Metrics
‚ùå **Wrong**: "Maintain 95/95 test pass rate"
‚úÖ **Right**: "Ensure all tests pass"

### 3. Environment Specifics
‚ùå **Wrong**: "Work in /Users/project/alphapy"
‚úÖ **Right**: "Work with the AlphaPy codebase"

### 4. Tool Restrictions
‚ùå **Wrong**: Listing every available tool
‚úÖ **Right**: Only mention if restricted from certain tools

## Examples of Good Agent Definitions

### Clear Specialization
```markdown
# Role
You are a Senior ML Engineer with 8+ years experience in 
financial machine learning and algorithmic trading systems.
```

### Specific Triggers
```markdown
description: Use when implementing ML algorithms, feature 
engineering, or model optimization. Invoke for sklearn/XGBoost 
issues or trading strategy development.
```

### Clear Handoff
```markdown
## My Core Role
I implement ML algorithms and feature engineering, then delegate 
financial logic to fintech-specialist and testing to qa-engineer.
```

## Testing Your Agent

1. **Check Structure**: Ensure all required sections present
2. **Remove State**: No project-specific numbers or metrics
3. **Clear Triggers**: Description clearly states when to use
4. **Delegation Flow**: Handoff patterns make sense
5. **Self-Contained**: Works without external context

## File Naming Convention

- Use lowercase with hyphens: `ml-engineer.md`
- Match the `name:` field in frontmatter
- Keep names concise but descriptive
- Avoid redundant prefixes (e.g., not `python-ml-engineer`)

## Activating Your Agent

Once created, users can activate your agent with:
```
/agents your-agent-name
```

The agent will then handle all subsequent interactions according to its defined role and expertise.

# Appendix: Meet the Team

Get to know your colleagues! This section introduces each team member as a person - their background, personality, and what makes them valuable to the team. Use these descriptions to understand who to collaborate with and why.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note on Names

**The persona names (like "Alex Chen" or "Sophie Martinez") are for this guide only!** 

When creating your agent and defining workflows:
- ‚úÖ **DO** reference agents by their role: `backend-developer`, `product-manager`
- ‚ùå **DON'T** use persona names: ~~"delegate to Alex"~~, ~~"ask Sophie"~~

## Creating Your Own Agent

When creating a new agent, think about:
1. **Who are they?** - Background and experience that shapes their perspective
2. **What's their personality?** - How do they approach problems?
3. **Why hire them?** - What unique value do they bring?
4. **How do they collaborate?** - Who do they work well with?

Remember: 
- Agents should feel like real team members with distinct expertise and personalities
- Use role names (not persona names) in actual agent definitions and workflows
- Each agent should have a clear specialty that doesn't completely overlap with others
