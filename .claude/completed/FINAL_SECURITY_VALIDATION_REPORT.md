## Security Architecture Improvements

### 1. Transform Security Framework
```python
# Before: Dangerous dynamic execution
exec(f"from alphapy.{module} import {function_name}")

# After: Secure whitelist validation
if function_name not in APPROVED_TRANSFORMS:
    raise SecurityError(f"Attempted to use non-approved transform '{function_name}'")
```

### 2. Safe Expression Evaluation
```python
# Before: Direct eval() usage
result = eval(expression)

# After: AST-based safety
safe_evaluator = SafeExpressionEvaluator()
result = safe_evaluator.evaluate(expression, context)
```

### 3. Financial Calculation Security
```python
# Before: eval() for portfolio attributes
bdata[i] = eval(f'pos.{weightby}')

# After: Whitelisted attribute access
if weightby in valid_attrs:
    bdata[i] = getattr(pos, weightby, 0.0)
```

## Production Security Recommendations

### Immediate Deployment âœ…
