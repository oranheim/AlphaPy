## 🔄 IN PROGRESS

### Documentation
- [ ] Update README.md with new Python version requirements
- [ ] Document new test suite in tests/README.md
- [ ] Create user migration guide from old version

## 📋 TODO - High Priority

### 1. Test Coverage Improvement
**Current**: 36% | **Target**: 70%
- [ ] Add tests for portfolio.py (currently 23% coverage)
- [ ] Add tests for system.py (currently 18% coverage)
- [ ] Add tests for market_flow.py (minimal coverage)
- [ ] Add tests for sport_flow.py (minimal coverage)
- [ ] Add integration tests for full ML pipeline

### 2. Documentation
- [ ] API documentation with Sphinx
- [ ] Example notebooks for common use cases
- [ ] Trading strategy examples
- [ ] Sports prediction examples
- [ ] Configuration guide for YAML files

### 3. Performance Optimization
- [ ] Profile training pipeline for bottlenecks
- [ ] Optimize feature engineering for large datasets
- [ ] Add parallel processing for model training
- [ ] Implement caching for repeated calculations

## 📋 TODO - Medium Priority

### 4. Feature Enhancements
- [ ] Add more modern ML models (XGBoost 2.0 features)
- [ ] Implement AutoML capabilities
- [ ] Add real-time data streaming support
- [ ] Enhanced backtesting framework
- [ ] Add portfolio optimization algorithms

### 5. Code Quality
- [ ] Implement logging throughout codebase
- [ ] Add performance benchmarks
- [ ] Create integration test suite
- [ ] Add code quality checks to CI workflow (not local pre-commit)

### 6. DevOps & Deployment
- [ ] Create Docker container
- [ ] Add GitHub release automation
- [ ] Setup automatic PyPI publishing
- [ ] Add code coverage badges
- [ ] Implement continuous deployment

## 📋 TODO - Low Priority

### 7. Refactoring Opportunities
- [ ] Consider splitting large modules (features.py ~1500 lines)
- [ ] Standardize error handling patterns
- [ ] Improve configuration validation
- [ ] Add data validation schemas

### 8. Community & Ecosystem
- [ ] Create contributing guidelines
- [ ] Setup issue templates
- [ ] Add code of conduct
- [ ] Create discussions forum
- [ ] Write blog post about modernization

## 🚫 NOT TODO (Explicitly Out of Scope)

Per project requirements, these are NOT to be done:
- ❌ Changing core algorithms or business logic
- ❌ Breaking backward compatibility
- ❌ Removing legacy functionality
- ❌ Major architectural changes
- ❌ Changing API interfaces

## 📊 Progress Metrics

| Category | Status | Completion |
|----------|--------|------------|
| Core Modernization | ✅ Complete | 100% |
| Type Safety | ✅ Complete | 100% |
| Test Suite | ✅ Complete | 100% |
| CI/CD Pipeline | ✅ Complete | 100% |
| Documentation | 🔄 In Progress | 20% |
| Test Coverage | 🔄 Needs Work | 36% |
| Performance | ⏸️ Not Started | 0% |
| Features | ⏸️ Not Started | 0% |

## 🎯 Next Sprint Priorities

1. **Improve test coverage** to 50% minimum
2. **Update documentation** for users
3. **Create example notebooks** for onboarding
4. **Setup Docker container** for easy deployment

## 📝 Notes

- All critical modernization work is complete
- Focus should shift to documentation and usability
- Test coverage improvement would reduce regression risk
- Performance optimization can wait until usage patterns emerge
